	\noindent This work proposes a method for charging and discharging the batteries in Electric Vehicles (EV). The classification of Electric vehicles is Private Vehicle, Commercial Vehicle, Emergency Vehicle, VIP Vehicle based on the battery capacity and vehicle's usage.
	
	\noindent The State of Charge (SoC) of each vehicle is calculated for every twenty minutes and compared with the threshold limits of SoC. The Distance traveled and the time for which it is connected to the grid is fixed for each vehicle type. The ideal pattern has been established by comparing the charging pattern with the scheduled Real Time Pricing (RTP) for every 20-minute block. Here 20-minute blocks are considered because the time required for full charge varies from vehicle to vehicle. The pattern has been formulated in such a way that discharging occurs when the cost is higher (peak hours), charging occurs when the cost is low (off peak hours). Few blocks are left idle when charging or discharging is not feasible because of violation of threshold limits. The total price has been calculated for each vehicle for a span of 24 hours after the charging and discharging patterns are established.
	
	\noindent The novelty of this work is the establishment of a travel pattern for the classified types of vehicles and thereby arriving at the best charging/discharging patterns.
	
	
	\noindent \textbf{Specific Contribution}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Establishing the travel pattern for the classified vehicles by using the vehicle's battery capacity and how much time it takes to complete its trip.
		
	\end{itemize}
	\noindent \textbf{Specific Learning}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Understood about various ranges of battery capacities of the vehicles and time to complete its trip after one time charging.
