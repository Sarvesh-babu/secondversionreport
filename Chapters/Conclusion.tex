	Therefore in this study we have classeified the Electric Vehicles, determined their Travel Pattern, estimated their Charging/Discharging Pattern with the help of `$Rtp$', thereby finding the best time period to charge the vehicle with respect to cost for the considered data and have verified that, when the the EVs are connected to a strong bus the losses are less and viceversa.
