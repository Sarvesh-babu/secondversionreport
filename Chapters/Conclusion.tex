	In this study the Electric Vehicles have been classified based on their utility and their Travel Pattern has been established.  The Charging/Discharging Pattern has been estimated with the help of `$RTP$'.This helps in identifying the best time period to charge the vehicle with respect to cost for the considered data. Evs have been placed at a strong bus and a weak bus and the system's performance is investigated.
